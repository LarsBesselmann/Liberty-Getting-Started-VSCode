# Lab: Using Open Liberty Tools with VS Code

## Objectives

In this exercise, you will learn how developers can use Liberty in “dev” mode with VS Code Integrated Development Environment for achieving efficient iterative develop, test, debug cycle when developing Java based applications and microservices.

At the end of this lab you should be able to:

  - Experience using the Open Liberty Tools extension available in VS
    Code to efficiently develop, test, and debug Java cloud native
    applications.

  - Experience hot reloading of application code and configuration
    changes using dev mode

You will need an estimated **60 to 90 minutes** to complete this lab.


## Lab requirements

  - Use the lab environment that we prepared for this lab. It already has the prerequisite software installed and configured.
